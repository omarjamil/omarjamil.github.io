I am a Senior Research Software Engineer at University of Exeter's Institute for Data Science and AI. Prior to this I was a Senior Scientist at the UK Met Office, using machine learning to develop and improve the physics in the weather and climate model. I have a PhD in Physics from University of Southampton and MPhys from University of Warwick.
